# wp-buttonbar

This is a plugin designed for the Offices theme. It sets up a widget area, named "Button bar", which will appear on a site as a fixed-position area in the lower right of the page. This is intended primarily for button widgets, like on [SAVP](https://offices.vassar.edu/savp) or [Faculty Housing](https://offices.vassar.edu/faculty-housing/).
